Infrastructure as code.

###  What is IaC?

- IaC stands for Infrastructure as Code. It means writing code to manage and provision infrastructure resources like servers, networks, and storage. This approach automates the deployment and configuration of infrastructure, making it easier to manage, scale, and replicate environments. Benefits of IaC include improved consistency, faster deployment, reduced errors, and easier collaboration among team members.

### Use cases:

- Provisioning and configuration of infrastructure: IaC is used to automate the creation and configuration of servers, networks, and other infrastructure components. This can include configuring operating systems, installing software, setting up firewalls, and creating user accounts. Cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP offer IaC tools like CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager, and Google Cloud Deployment Manager to help automate these tasks.

- Application deployment: IaC can be used to automate the deployment of applications to infrastructure resources. This can include installing software, configuring settings, and deploying code. Tools like Ansible, Chef, and Puppet can be used to manage application deployment across different environments.

- Testing and validation: IaC can be used to create and manage test environments, including infrastructure and applications. This can help automate testing and validation tasks, ensuring that changes are thoroughly tested before being deployed to production.

- Compliance and security: IaC can help ensure that infrastructure and applications meet security and compliance requirements. By automating the configuration of security settings and policies, IaC can help reduce the risk of security breaches and ensure that infrastructure is compliant with regulations like HIPAA or PCI DSS.

### How is it used in the industry?

- Some companies that use IaC include Netflix, Airbnb, and Google. These companies use IaC to manage large, complex environments and to scale their infrastructure efficiently. In addition, many startups and small businesses are adopting IaC to improve their infrastructure management and to reduce the time and effort required for infrastructure management tasks.

### Configuration management.

- Configuration management is the process of managing and automating changes to infrastructure configurations, such as servers, applications, and network devices. Configuration management tools help track and manage changes, enforce consistency, and maintain desired configurations over time.

### What is Ansible?

- Ansible is a popular open-source configuration management and automation tool. It uses a simple syntax called YAML to define infrastructure resources and configurations in playbooks. Ansible can manage a wide range of devices and platforms, from servers to cloud resources, and has a large user community and ecosystem of modules and plugins. Some use cases for Ansible include configuration management, application deployment, and continuous delivery.

### What is YAML and playbooks?

- YAML (short for "YAML Ain't Markup Language") is a human-readable data serialization format. It's used in Ansible playbooks to define infrastructure resources and configurations in a structured way. 
- Playbooks are sets of instructions that define a series of tasks to be executed on remote hosts using Ansible. Playbooks can include conditionals, loops, and variables, making them a powerful way to automate complex workflows.
